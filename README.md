# Quick and Dirty JSON Libraries test

I found a lot of information on using different libraries for serialize/deserialize JSON, but I couldn't find an article or code where I had an evalutaion of each library.

So I have decided to start implementing and trying to figure out which library is better suitable to my case.

Hope it can help someone else!
